A powerful and unified HTTP mocking ecosystem for Dart & Flutter tests, inspired by `OHHTTPStubs`.

Joker provides a single, fluent, and consistent API to stub network requests, making your tests clean, fast, and reliable. It's designed from the ground up to work with popular clients like `http` and `dio` across all platforms (mobile, desktop, and web).

## ‚ú® Features

* **Unified API:** Learn one API, mock everything. Use the same `Joker.when(...)` syntax to mock both `http` and `dio` requests.
* **Non-Invasive on Native:** Thanks to Dart's `HttpOverrides`, Joker can automatically intercept all network traffic on mobile and desktop without any changes to your application code.
* **Cross-Platform Ready:** A first-class, consistent testing experience whether you're running tests on the Dart VM (IO) or in the browser (Web).
* **Fluent & Expressive:** A declarative API that makes your test stubs easy to write and understand.
* **Extensible Ecosystem:** Built as a modular platform, ready for future adapters to support other clients.
